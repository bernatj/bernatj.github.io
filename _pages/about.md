I am a postdoctoral researcher at IGEO (CSIC-UCM) with extensive experience in atmospheric dynamics, predictability, and numerical modeling of weather and climate. My research involves understanding the complex interactions within the climate system. This includes the remote influence (teleconnections) of phenomena, such as El Ni√±o - Southern Oscillation, and the stratospheric polar vortex, which have important consequences for seasonal predictions. I have also investigated heat extremes and their relationship with atmospheric variability and external forcings, e.g. topography. To do my research, I have used a combination of observational data, reanalysis products and model simulations. This includes configuring and developing numerical weather prediction (NWP) and general circulation (GCM) models. In my recent work, I have started incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence to gain a deeper understanding of the climate system.
